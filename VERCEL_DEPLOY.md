## Deploying to Vercel

This project is ready for immediate deployment on Vercel.

### Steps:
1. Push your code to a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and import your repository.
3. Vercel will auto-detect this as a Next.js project and use the default settings.
4. Set any environment variables in the Vercel dashboard if needed.
5. Click "Deploy".

No further configuration is required for a standard Next.js app.
